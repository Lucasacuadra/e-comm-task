# Note to reviewer

All features are finished and tested with the exception of the hover lens view. After many hours of trial and testing and a small family emergency, I was unable to complete this task without the use of third parties. I will be more than happy and ready to discuss the issues I was having with this and I am very interested in hearing the final solution.

Thank you,
Lucas
